# CS 300 – Portfolio Reflection

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In CS 300, the main problem I worked on was learning how to store, organize, and access course data efficiently. In Project One, I compared different data structures and analyzed their run-time and memory usage. In Project Two, I created a working program that loads course information, sorts it in alphanumeric order, and prints the results correctly.

## How did you approach the problem?
I started by understanding what each data structure was designed to do and how it performs with larger data sets. This helped me decide which structure made the most sense for the problem. Learning this showed me why data structures matter and how they directly affect how well a program runs.

## How did you overcome roadblocks you encountered?
Some challenges came up with sorting logic and making sure the output was correct. I worked through these issues by breaking the program into smaller steps and testing often. When something didn’t work, I reviewed the logic and fixed it instead of restarting everything.

## How has this project expanded your approach to designing software?
This project helped me slow down and plan more before writing code. I now think more about how data will be stored and used before I start programming. That change has helped me write programs that are more organized and easier to manage.

## How has this project evolved the way you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?
Working on these projects pushed me to write clearer code with better naming and structure. This makes my programs easier to read and update later. I am more aware now of writing code that can be changed or expanded without causing problems.
